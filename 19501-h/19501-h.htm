<h2>THE BOY SCOUT</h2>


<p>A rule of the Boy Scouts is every day to do some one a good turn. Not
because the copy-books tell you it deserves another, but in spite of
that pleasing possibility. If you are a true scout, until you have
performed your act of kindness your day is dark. You are as unhappy
as is the grown-up who has begun his day without shaving or reading
the New York <i>Sun</i>. But as soon as you have proved yourself you may,
with a clear conscience, look the world in the face and untie the
knot in your kerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Jimmie Reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten
minutes past eight on a hot August morning after he had given one
dime to his sister Sadie. With that she could either witness the
first-run films at the Palace, or by dividing her fortune patronize
two of the nickel shows on Lenox Avenue. The choice Jimmie left to
her. He was setting out for the annual encampment of the Boy Scouts
at Hunter's Island, and in the excitement of that adventure even the
movies ceased to thrill. But Sadie also could be unselfish. With a
heroism of a camp-fire maiden she made a gesture which might have
been interpreted to mean she was returning the money.</p>

<p>"I can't, Jimmie!" she gasped. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> can't take it off you. You saved it,
and you ought to get the fun of it."</p>

<p>"I haven't saved it yet," said Jimmie. "I'm going to cut it out of the
railroad fare. I'm going to get off at City Island instead of at Pelham
Manor and walk the difference. That's ten cents cheaper."</p>

<p>Sadie exclaimed with admiration:</p>

<p>"An' you carryin' that heavy grip!"</p>

<p>"Aw, that's nothin'," said the man of the family.</p>

<p>"Good-by, mother. So long, Sadie."</p>

<p>To ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised Sadie
to take in "The Curse of Cain" rather than "The Mohawks' Last Stand,"
and fled down the front steps.</p>

<p>He wore his khaki uniform. On his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> shoulders was his knapsack, from
his hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his
"shorts" his kneecaps, unkissed by the sun, as yet unscathed by
blackberry vines, showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl.
As he moved toward the "L" station at the corner, Sadie and his mother
waved to him; in the street, boys too small to be scouts hailed him
enviously; even the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the
news-stand nodded approval.</p>

<p>"You a Scout, Jimmie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," retorted Jimmie, for was not he also in uniform? "I'm Santa Claus
out filling Christmas stockings."</p>

<p>The patrolman also possessed a ready wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>"Then get yourself a pair," he advised. "If a dog was to see your
legs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the Elevated.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>An hour later, with his valise in one hand and staff in the other, he
was tramping up the Boston Post Road and breathing heavily. The day was
cruelly hot. Before his eyes, over an interminable stretch of asphalt,
the heat waves danced and flickered. Already the knapsack on his
shoulders pressed upon him like an Old Man of the Sea; the linen in the
valise had turned to pig iron, his pipe-stem legs were wabbling, his
eyes smarted with salt sweat, and the fingers supporting the valise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
belonged to some other boy, and were giving that boy much pain. But as
the motor-cars flashed past with raucous warnings, or, that those who
rode might better see the boy with bare knees, passed at "half speed,"
Jimmie stiffened his shoulders and stepped jauntily forward. Even when
the joy-riders mocked with "Oh, you Scout!" he smiled at them. He was
willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who
walked. And he regretted&mdash;oh, so bitterly&mdash;having left the train. He was
indignant that for his "one good turn a day" he had not selected one
less strenuous. That, for instance, he had not assisted a frightened old
lady through the traffic. To refuse the dime she might have offered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> as
all true scouts refuse all tips, would have been easier than to earn it
by walking five miles, with the sun at ninety-nine degrees, and carrying
excess baggage. Twenty times James shifted the valise to the other hand,
twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it.</p>

<p>And then, as again he took up his burden, the Good Samaritan drew near.
He drew near in a low gray racing-car at the rate of forty miles an
hour, and within a hundred feet of Jimmie suddenly stopped and backed
toward him. The Good Samaritan was a young man with white hair. He wore
a suit of blue, a golf cap; the hands that held the wheel were disguised
in large yellow gloves. He brought the car to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> halt and surveyed the
dripping figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes.</p>

<p>"You a Boy Scout?" he asked.</p>

<p>With alacrity for the twenty-first time <a name="illustration" id="illustration"></a>Jimmie dropped the valise,
forced his cramped fingers into straight lines, and saluted.</p>

<p>The young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him.</p>

<p>"Get in," he commanded.</p>

<p>When James sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man, to
Jimmie's disappointment, did not continue to shatter the speed limit.
Instead, he seemed inclined for conversation, and the car, growling
indignantly, crawled.</p>

<p>"I never saw a Boy Scout before," announced the old young man. "Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> me
about it. First, tell me what you do when you're not scouting."</p>

<p>Jimmie explained volubly. When not in uniform he was an office-boy and
from pedlers and beggars guarded the gates of Carroll and Hastings,
stockbrokers. He spoke the names of his employers with awe. It was a
firm distinguished, conservative, and long-established. The white-haired
young man seemed to nod in assent.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" demanded Jimmie suspiciously. "Are you a customer of
ours?"</p>

<p>"I know them," said the young man. "They are customers of mine."</p>

<p>Jimmie wondered in what way Carroll and Hastings were customers of the
white-haired young man. Judging him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> by his outer garments, Jimmie
guessed he was a Fifth Avenue tailor; he might be even a haberdasher.
Jimmie continued. He lived, he explained, with his mother at One Hundred
and Forty-sixth Street; Sadie, his sister, attended the public school;
he helped support them both, and he now was about to enjoy a well-earned
vacation camping out on Hunter's Island, where he would cook his own
meals and, if the mosquitoes permitted, sleep in a tent.</p>

<p>"And you like that?" demanded the young man. "You call that fun?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" protested Jimmie. "Don't <i>you</i> go camping out?"</p>

<p>"I go camping out," said the Good Samaritan, "whenever I leave New
York."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Jimmie had not for three years lived in Wall Street not to understand
that the young man spoke in metaphor.</p>

<p>"You don't look," objected the young man critically, "as though you were
built for the strenuous life."</p>

<p>Jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees.</p>

<p>"You ought ter see me two weeks from now," he protested. "I get all
sunburnt and hard&mdash;hard as anything!"</p>

<p>The young man was incredulous.</p>

<p>"You were near getting sunstroke when I picked you up," he laughed. "If
you're going to Hunter's Island why didn't you take the Third Avenue to
Pelham Manor?"</p>

<p>"That's right!" assented Jimmie ea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>gerly. "But I wanted to save the ten
cents so's to send Sadie to the movies. So I walked."</p>

<p>The young man looked his embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he murmured.</p>

<p>But Jimmie did not hear him. From the back of the car he was dragging
excitedly at the hated suitcase.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded. "I got ter get out. I got ter <i>walk</i>."</p>

<p>The young man showed his surprise.</p>

<p>"Walk!" he exclaimed. "What is it&mdash;a bet?"</p>

<p>Jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway. It took some
time to explain to the young man. First, he had to be told about the
scout law and the one good turn a day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> that it must involve some
personal sacrifice. And, as Jimmie pointed out, changing from a slow
suburban train to a racing-car could not be listed as a sacrifice. He
had not earned the money, Jimmie argued; he had only avoided paying it
to the railroad. If he did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude
of Sadie by a falsehood. Therefore, he must walk.</p>

<p>"Not at all," protested the young man. "You've got it wrong. What good
will it do your sister to have you sunstruck? I think you <i>are</i>
sunstruck. You're crazy with the heat. You get in here, and we'll talk
it over as we go along."</p>

<p>Hastily Jimmie backed away. "I'd rather walk," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>The young man shifted his legs irritably.</p>

<p>"Then how'll this suit you?" he called. "We'll declare that first 'one
good turn' a failure and start afresh. Do <i>me</i> a good turn."</p>

<p>Jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Hunter's Island Inn," called the young man, "and I've lost
my way. You get in here and guide me. That'll be doing me a good turn."</p>

<p>On either side of the road, blotting out the landscape, giant hands
picked out in electric-light bulbs pointed the way to Hunter's Island
Inn. Jimmie grinned and nodded toward them.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," he called, "I got ter walk." Turning his back upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
temptation, he wabbled forward into the flickering heat waves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The young man did not attempt to pursue. At the side of the road, under
the shade of a giant elm, he had brought the car to a halt and with his
arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless, following with frowning eyes
the retreating figure of Jimmie. But the narrow-chested and knock-kneed
boy staggering over the sun-baked asphalt no longer concerned him. It
was not Jimmie, but the code preached by Jimmie, and not only preached
but before his eyes put into practice, that interested him. The young
man with white hair had been running away from temptation. At forty
miles an hour he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> been running away from the temptation to do a
fellow mortal "a good turn." That morning, to the appeal of a drowning
C&aelig;sar to "Help me, Cassius, or I sink," he had answered, "Sink!" That
answer he had no wish to reconsider. That he might not reconsider he had
sought to escape. It was his experience that a sixty-horsepower
racing-machine is a jealous mistress. For retrospective, sentimental, or
philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence. But he had not
escaped. Jimmie had halted him, tripped him by the heels and set him
again to thinking. Within the half-hour that followed those who rolled
past saw at the side of the road a car with her engine running, and
leaning upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> wheel, as unconscious of his surroundings as though he
sat at his own fireplace, a young man who frowned and stared at nothing.
The half-hour passed and the young man swung his car back toward the
city. But at the first roadhouse that showed a blue-and-white telephone
sign he left it, and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a
nickel. He wished to communicate with Mr. Carroll, of Carroll and
Hastings; and when he learned Mr. Carroll had just issued orders that he
must not be disturbed, the young man gave his name.</p>

<p>The effect upon the barkeeper was instantaneous. With the aggrieved air
of one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>"What are you putting over?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The young man smiled reassuringly. He had begun to speak and, though
apparently engaged with the beer-glass he was polishing, the barkeeper
listened.</p>

<p>Down in Wall Street the senior member of Carroll and Hastings also
listened. He was alone in the most private of all his private offices,
and when interrupted had been engaged in what, of all undertakings, is
the most momentous. On the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer, to
the coroner, to his wife; and hidden by a mass of papers, but within
reach of his hand, an automatic pistol. The promise it offered of swift
release had made the writing of the letters simple, had given him a
feeling of com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>plete detachment, had released him, at least in thought,
from all responsibilities. And when at his elbow the telephone coughed
discreetly, it was as though some one had called him from a world from
which already he had made his exit.</p>

<p>Mechanically, through mere habit, he lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>The voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences.</p>

<p>"That letter I sent this morning? Forget it. Tear it up. I've been
thinking and I'm going to take a chance. I've decided to back you boys,
and I know you'll make good. I'm speaking from a roadhouse in the Bronx;
going straight from here to the bank. So you can begin to draw against
us within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> an hour. And&mdash;hello!&mdash;will three millions see you through?"</p>

<p>From Wall Street there came no answer, but from the hands of the
barkeeper a glass crashed to the floor.</p>

<p>The young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>"He doesn't answer," he exclaimed. "He must have hung up."</p>

<p>"He must have fainted!" said the barkeeper.</p>

<p>The white-haired one pushed a bill across the counter. "To pay for
breakage," he said, and disappeared down Pelham Parkway.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, with the bill, for evidence, pasted against the
mirror, the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>"He stood just where you're standing now," he related, "blowing in
million-dollar bills like you'd blow suds off a beer. If I'd knowed it
was <i>him</i>, I'd have hit him once, and hid him in the cellar for the
reward. Who'd I think he was? I thought he was a wire-tapper, working a
con game!"</p>

<p>Mr. Carroll had not "hung up," but when in the Bronx the beer-glass
crashed, in Wall Street the receiver had slipped from the hand of the
man who held it, and the man himself had fallen forward. His desk hit
him in the face and woke him&mdash;woke him to the wonderful fact that he
still lived; that at forty he had been born again; that before him
stretched many more years in which, as the young man with the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hair had pointed out, he still could make good.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far advanced when the staff of Carroll and Hastings
were allowed to depart, and, even late as was the hour, two of them were
asked to remain. Into the most private of the private offices Carroll
invited Gaskell, the head clerk; in the main office Hastings had asked
young Thorne, the bond clerk, to be seated.</p>

<p>Until the senior partner has finished with Gaskell young Thorne must
remain seated.</p>

<p>"Gaskell," said Mr. Carroll, "if we had listened to you, if we'd run
this place as it was when father was alive, this never would have
happened. It <i>hasn't</i> happened, but we've had our les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>son. And after
this we're going slow and going straight. And we don't need you to tell
us how to do that. We want you to go away&mdash;on a month's vacation. When I
thought we were going under I planned to send the children on a
sea-voyage with the governess&mdash;so they wouldn't see the newspapers. But
now that I can look them in the eye again, I need them, I can't let them
go. So, if you'd like to take your wife on an ocean trip to Nova Scotia
and Quebec, here are the cabins I reserved for the kids. They call it
the Royal Suite&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;and the trip lasts a month. The boat
sails to-morrow morning. Don't sleep too late or you may miss her."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The head clerk was secreting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> tickets in the inside pocket of his
waistcoat. His fingers trembled, and when he laughed his voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Miss the boat!" the head clerk exclaimed. "If she gets away from Millie
and me she's got to start now. We'll go on board to-night!"</p>

<p>A half-hour later Millie was on her knees packing a trunk, and her
husband was telephoning to the drug-store for a sponge bag and a cure
for seasickness.</p>

<p>Owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on her knees,
Millie was alternately weeping into the trunk-tray and offering up
incoherent prayers of thanksgiving. Suddenly she sank back upon the
floor.</p>

<p>"John!" she cried, "doesn't it seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> sinful to sail away in a 'royal
suite' and leave this beautiful flat empty?"</p>

<p>Over the telephone John was having trouble with the drug clerk.</p>

<p>"No!" he explained, "I'm not seasick <i>now</i>. The medicine I want is to be
taken later. I <i>know</i> I'm speaking from the Pavonia; but the Pavonia
isn't a ship; it's an apartment-house."</p>

<p>He turned to Millie. "We can't be in two places at the same time," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"But, think," insisted Millie, "of all the poor people stifling to-night
in this heat, trying to sleep on the roofs and fire-escapes; and our
flat so cool and big and pretty&mdash;and no one in it."</p>

<p>John nodded his head proudly.</p>

<p>"I know it's big," he said, "but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> isn't big enough to hold all the
people who are sleeping to-night on the roofs and in the parks."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of your brother&mdash;and Grace," said Millie. "They've been
married only two weeks now, and they're in a stuffy hall bedroom and
eating with all the other boarders. Think what our flat would mean to
them; to be by themselves, with eight rooms and their own kitchen and
bath, and our new refrigerator and the gramophone! It would be Heaven!
It would be a real honeymoon!"</p>

<p>Abandoning the drug clerk, John lifted Millie in his arms and kissed
her, for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The younger brother and Grace were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> sitting on the stoop of the
boardinghouse. On the upper steps, in their shirt-sleeves, were the
other boarders; so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers. The air
of the cross street was stale and stagnant; from it rose exhalations of
rotting fruit, the gases of an open subway, the smoke of passing
taxicabs. But between the street and the hall bedroom, with its odors of
a gas-stove and a kitchen, the choice was difficult.</p>

<p>"We've got to cool off somehow," the young husband was saying, "or you
won't sleep. Shall we treat ourselves to ice-cream sodas or a trip on
the Weehawken ferry-boat?"</p>

<p>"The ferry-boat!" begged the girl, "where we can get away from all these
people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>A taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street, kicked itself
to a stop, and the head clerk and Millie spilled out upon the pavement.
They talked so fast, and the younger brother and Grace talked so fast,
that the boarders, although they listened intently, could make nothing
of it.</p>

<p>They distinguished only the concluding sentences:</p>

<p>"Why don't you drive down to the wharf with us," they heard the elder
brother ask, "and see our royal suite?"</p>

<p>But the younger brother laughed him to scorn.</p>

<p>"What's your royal suite," he mocked, "to our royal palace?"</p>

<p>An hour later, had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head
clerk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling
murmur of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of
"Alexander's Ragtime Band."</p>

<p>When in his private office Carroll was making a present of the royal
suite to the head clerk, in the main office Hastings, the junior
partner, was addressing "Champ" Thorne, the bond clerk. He addressed him
familiarly and affectionately as "Champ." This was due partly to the
fact that twenty-six years before Thorne had been christened Champneys
and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven of one
of the Big Three to the championship.</p>

<p>"Champ," said Mr. Hastings, "last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> month, when you asked me to raise
your salary, the reason I didn't do it was not because you didn't
deserve it, but because I believed if we gave you a raise you'd
immediately get married."</p>

<p>The shoulders of the ex-football captain rose aggressively; he snorted
with indignation.</p>

<p>"And why should I <i>not</i> get married?" he demanded. "You're a fine one to
talk! You're the most offensively happy married man I ever met."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I know I am happy better than you do," reproved the junior
partner; "but I know also that it takes money to support a wife."</p>

<p>"You raise me to a hundred a week," urged Champ, "and I'll make it
support a wife whether it supports me or not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>"A month ago," continued Hastings, "we could have <i>promised</i> you a
hundred, but we didn't know how long we could pay it. We didn't want you
to rush off and marry some fine girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some fine girl!" muttered Mr. Thorne. "The Finest Girl!"</p>

<p>"The finer the girl," Hastings pointed out, "the harder it would have
been for you if we had failed and you had lost your job."</p>

<p>The eyes of the young man opened with sympathy and concern.</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Hastings sighed happily.</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i>," he said, "but this morning the Young Man of Wall Street did
us a good turn&mdash;saved us&mdash;saved our creditors, saved our homes, saved
our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> honor. We're going to start fresh and pay our debts, and we agreed
the first debt we paid would be the small one we owe you. You've brought
us more than we've given, and if you'll stay with us we're going to
'see' your fifty and raise it a hundred. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Young Mr. Thorne leaped to his feet. What he said was: "Where'n hell's
my hat?"</p>

<p>But by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners.</p>

<p>"I say, 'thank you a thousand times,'" he shouted over his shoulder.
"Excuse me, but I've got to go. I've got to break the news to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not explain to whom he was going to break the news; but Hastings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
must have guessed, for again he sighed happily and then, a little
hysterically, laughed aloud. Several months had passed since he had
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to break the news Champ Thorne almost broke his neck. In
his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the
elevator was going down or coming up, and sooner than wait to find out
he started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the
elevator-door swung open.</p>

<p>"You get five dollars," he announced to the elevator man, "if you drop
to the street without a stop. Beat the speed limit! Act like the
building is on fire and you're trying to save me before the roof
falls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Senator Barnes and his entire family, which was his daughter Barbara,
were at the Ritz-Carlton. They were in town in August because there was
a meeting of the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber Company, of
which company Senator Barnes was president. It was a secret meeting.
Those directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been
summoned by telegraph; those who were steaming across the ocean, by
wireless.</p>

<p>Up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal, sickening,
grim, terrible. As yet it burned beneath the surface, giving out only
an odor, but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself. At any moment it
might break into flame. For the directors, was it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> better wisdom to
let the scandal smoulder, and take a chance, or to be the first to give
the alarm, the first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out?</p>

<p>It was to decide this that, in the heat of August, the directors and the
president had foregathered.</p>

<p>Champ Thorne knew nothing of this; he knew only that by a miracle
Barbara Barnes was in town; that at last he was in a position to ask
her to marry him; that she would certainly say she would. That was all
he cared to know.</p>

<p>A year before he had issued his declaration of independence. Before he
could marry, he told her, he must be able to support a wife on what he
earned, without her having to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> money from her father, and until
he received "a minimum wage" of five thousand dollars they must wait.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with my father's money?" Barbara had demanded.</p>

<p>Thorne had evaded the direct question.</p>

<p>"There is too much of it," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you object to the way he makes it?" insisted Barbara. "Because
rubber is most useful. You put it in golf balls and auto tires and
galoches. There is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoches. And
what is there 'tainted' about a raincoat."</p>

<p>Thorne shook his head unhappily.</p>

<p>"It's not the finished product to which I refer," he stammered; "it's
the way they get the raw material."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>"They get it out of trees," said Barbara. Then she exclaimed with
enlightenment&mdash;"Oh!" she cried, "you are thinking of the Congo. There it
is terrible! <i>That</i> is slavery. But there are no slaves on the Amazon.
The natives are free and the work is easy. They just tap the trees the
way the farmers gather sugar in Vermont. Father has told me about it
often."</p>

<p>Thorne had made no comment. He could abuse a friend, if the friend were
among those present, but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as
he disliked Senator Barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to
others. And he knew besides that, if the father she loved and the man
she loved distrusted each other, Barbara would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> not rest until she
learned the reason why.</p>

<p>One day, in a newspaper, Barbara read of the Puju Mayo atrocities, of
the Indian slaves in the jungles and back waters of the Amazon, who are
offered up as sacrifices to "red rubber." She carried the paper to her
father. What it said, her father told her, was untrue, and if it were
true it was the first he had heard of it.</p>

<p>Senator Barnes loved the good things of life, but the thing he loved
most was his daughter; the thing he valued the highest was her good
opinion. So when for the first time she looked at him in doubt, he
assured her he at once would order an investigation.</p>

<p>"But, of course," he added, "it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> be many months before our agents
can report. On the Amazon news travels very slowly."</p>

<p>In the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she said, "that that is true."</p>

<p>That was six months before the directors of the Brazil and Cuyaba Rubber
Company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the
Ritz-Carlton. They were due to arrive in half an hour, and while Senator
Barnes awaited their coming Barbara came to him. In her eyes was a light
that helped to tell the great news. It gave him a sharp, jealous pang.
He wanted at once to play a part in her happiness, to make her grateful
to him, not alone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> this stranger who was taking her away. So fearful
was he that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for
half his kingdom he would have parted with it.</p>

<p>"And besides giving my consent," said the rubber king, "for which no one
seems to have asked, what can I give my little girl to make her remember
her old father? Some diamonds to put on her head, or pearls to hang
around her neck, or does she want a vacant lot on Fifth Avenue?"</p>

<p>The lovely hands of Barbara rested upon his shoulders; her lovely face
was raised to his; her lovely eyes were appealing, and a little
frightened.</p>

<p>"What would one of those things cost?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>The question was eminently practical. It came within the scope of the
senator's understanding. After all, he was not to be cast into outer
darkness. His smile was complacent. He answered airily:</p>

<p>"Anything you like," he said; "a million dollars?"</p>

<p>The fingers closed upon his shoulders. The eyes, still frightened, still
searched his in appeal.</p>

<p>"Then for my wedding-present," said the girl, "I want you to take that
million dollars and send an expedition to the Amazon. And I will choose
the men. Men unafraid; men not afraid of fever or sudden death; not
afraid to tell the truth&mdash;even to <i>you</i>. And all the world will know.
And they&mdash;I mean <i>you</i>&mdash;will set those people free!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Senator Barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he
concealed under a manner of just indignation.</p>

<p>"My mind is made up," he told them. "Existing conditions cannot
continue. And to that end, at my own expense, I am sending an expedition
across South America. It will investigate, punish, and establish
reforms. I suggest, on account of this damned heat, we do now adjourn."</p>

<p>That night, over on Long Island, Carroll told his wife all, or nearly
all. He did not tell her about the automatic pistol. And together on
tiptoe they crept to the nursery and looked down at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> their sleeping
children. When she rose from her knees the mother said, "But how can I
thank him?"</p>

<p>By "him" she meant the Young Man of Wall Street.</p>

<p>"You never can thank him," said Carroll; "that's the worst of it."</p>

<p>But after a long silence the mother said: "I will send him a photograph
of the children. Do you think he will understand?"</p>

<p>Down at Seabright, Hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden.
The moon was so bright that the roses still held their color.</p>

<p>"I would like to thank him," said the young wife. She meant the Young
Man of Wall Street. "But for him we would have lost <i>this</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Her eyes caressed the garden, the fruit-trees, the house with wide,
hospitable verandas. "To-morrow I will send him some of these roses,"
said the young wife. "Will he understand that they mean our home?"</p>

<p>At a scandalously late hour, in a scandalous spirit of independence,
Champ Thorne and Barbara were driving around Central Park in a taxicab.</p>

<p>"How strangely the Lord moves, his wonders to perform," misquoted
Barbara. "Had not the Young Man of Wall Street saved Mr. Hastings, Mr.
Hastings could not have raised your salary; you would not have asked me
to marry you, and had you not asked me to marry you, father would not
have given me a wedding-present, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>"And," said Champ, taking up the tale, "thousands of slaves would still
be buried in the jungles, hidden away from their wives and children, and
the light of the sun and their fellow men. They still would be dying of
fever, starvation, tortures."</p>

<p>He took her hand in both of his and held her finger-tips against his
lips.</p>

<p>"And they will never know," he whispered, "when their freedom comes,
that they owe it all to <i>you</i>."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On Hunter's Island Jimmie Reeder and his bunkie, Sam Sturges, each on
his canvas cot, tossed and twisted. The heat, the moonlight, and the
mosquitoes would not let them even think of sleep.</p>

<p>"That was bully," said Jimmie, "what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> you did to-day about saving that
dog. If it hadn't been for you he'd ha' drownded."</p>

<p>"He would <i>not</i>!" said Sammy with punctilious regard for the truth; "it
wasn't deep enough."</p>

<p>"Well, the scout-master ought to know," argued Jimmie; "he said it was
the best 'one good turn' of the day!"</p>

<p>Modestly Sam shifted the limelight so that it fell upon his bunkie.</p>

<p>"I'll bet," he declared loyally, "<i>your</i> 'one good turn' was a better
one!"</p>

<p>Jimmie yawned, and then laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Me," he scoffed, "I didn't do nothing. I sent my sister to the
movies."</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
